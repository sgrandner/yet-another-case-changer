# Yet Another Case Changer README

## Features

Change/toggle case of selections to another.

Supported cases:
- supports simple upper and lower case
- supports snake, double snake, kebap, space, dot and camel in different upper and lower variants
- allows upper case abbreviations in camel case, e.g., qwerNMOPAsdfYxcv -> qwer-nmop-asdf-yxcv
- does not support some strange and unnecessary cases as, e.g.,  "upper inverse camel case" (QWERaSDFyXCV) and lower case abbreviations in camel case (qWERnmopaSDFyXCV)
- supports a custom case, e.g. with separator +, which can be defined in the settings (yet-another-case-changer.custom1-separator)

## Extension Settings

By default all commands are activated. Each of them can be deactivated in the settings. Editing the settings.json directly would be, e.g.,
